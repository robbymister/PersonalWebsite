                    <li>
                        Maintain and develop web apps written with Angular displaying meteorological data, used by Canadians everyday 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Built 2 major components of brand-new web app front-end, one using ag-grid and Highcharts for data analysis 
                        and other using OpenLayers (GIS) to track objects and place them on a map
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Used Angular, RxJs, Node.js and Material

                    <li>
                        Worked on back-end components, mainly an in-house search system and then introduced many new features
                        for accessibility, updating it to Angular from basic Javascript/jQuery and HTML
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Presented several meetings regarding feature development and key deliverables

                    <li>
                        Integrated every build on a Jenkins server and did monthly log checks for errors on Kibana
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Executed SQL queries and helped design data payloads for use in the front-end applications
